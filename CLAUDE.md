- if you create bots while we are developing, please do not create them started.
- Always think "How does 3Commas do it?" and do that.
- new work should be done in dev branches and merged after I confirm good
- always do git diff check before new git add to make sure we didn't lose functionality we want to keep
- we are now running from EC2.  Restarts should be done with "sudo systemctl restart trading-bot-backend"
